                <h2>
                    Our journey began by analyzing the brand’s current market standing and identifying key growth areas where we could make a significant impact:
                </h2>
                <ul class="challenge-li">
                    <li>
                        <span>1</span>
                        Despite having 36 physical stores, the brand operated multiple websites with different CMS platforms and back-ends, each managed by separate local teams. We were brought in to oversee and streamline the Spanish and Portuguese eCommerce websites.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>2</span>
                        There was a lack of reliable analytics across all sites, making it difficult for the brand to accurately monitor customer behavior and sales performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>3</span>
                        Over a span of two years, various external development teams were hired to launch new Magento-based websites—none of which reached completion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>4</span>
                        The existing websites, built on drag-and-drop platforms, lacked SEO capabilities, proper indexing, and the ability to drive organic traffic to product pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>5</span>
                        Missing filters, tags, and detailed product descriptions, along with a poorly structured site architecture, led to a subpar user experience and stagnant sales.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>6</span>
                        There was no robust infrastructure in place to handle a large product catalog. The team struggled to manage product listings, specifications, pricing, and models effectively.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>7</span>
                        Verified product reviews, even from loyal customers, were missing—undermining trust and credibility.

                                WooCommerce was selected for its flexibility and ease of deployment. It enabled us to manage all sites through a unified CMS while customizing design and localization based on geographic needs.

                                We aggregated data from Google Analytics, plugins, and custom dashboards into a single admin panel—ensuring transparency in purchase trends and generating weekly sales insights.

                            <p>
                                The Spanish and Portuguese stores went live within 2 months. Initial versions included product listings and key features, with monthly catalog improvements to enhance user experience and boost conversions.

                                Post-migration, we focused on SEO. Detailed traffic and competitor research helped us optimize category pages and top-selling products. This hybrid UX strategy bridged online and physical retail experiences.

                                We refined product tags, descriptions, filters, and categories to improve searchability and navigation—restructuring the internal SILO framework to elevate overall user experience.

                                Over 50,000 products were uploaded using existing data. Automated scripts enabled local teams to manage listings—updating specs, pricing, and models independently without relying on developers.

                                Reviews were collected from 8 countries, localized, and published across all sites. This improved brand trust, credibility, and provided strong social proof on product and category pages.

We accepted them into our accelerator program in 2017 (Batch 9), and they successfully completed it. In a short time, they developed an MVP, designed a go-to-market strategy, and launched the product in the US market. Their wide-ranging digital expertise and data-focused approach enabled them to execute swiftly and effectively.”
